# JaldiKaro

 A drag-and-drop website maker that helps you write code, generates front-end, connects to back-end, and produces a fully deployable website.

 JaldiKaro is a visual website builder focused on speed and developer ergonomics. Use the editor to drag and drop components, auto-generate the front-end code, and wire it to a backend service so you get a production-ready site fast.

 ## Key features

 - Visual drag-and-drop page editor for building layouts quickly.
 - Auto-generated front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS or framework-specific) you can inspect and edit.
 - Tools to help write and scaffold code snippets (components, routes, forms).
 - Connectors to wire the front-end to a backend (APIs, databases, auth) for a working full-stack app.
 - Export or deploy your site â€” production-ready build artifacts and deployment instructions.

 ## What this repository contains

 This project is the JaldiKaro workspace. It is intended to host the editor, example projects, and deployment artifacts so you can run and deploy a fully working website from the output.

 Note: If the repo already contains a frontend or backend subfolder, follow the specific README inside those folders for details.

 ## Quick start (generic)

 1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/samarthnaikk/JaldiKaro.git

 2. Change into the project directory:

    cd JaldiKaro

 3. Install dependencies (adjust for the package manager used by this project):

    npm install
    # or
    yarn install

 4. Run the development server (adjust command if the project uses a different script):

    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev

 5. Open the editor in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000 or as printed in the terminal).

 If this repo uses multiple services (frontend/backend), you may need to run each service in separate terminals. Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, or other manifests for exact instructions.

 ## Deployment

 - For static front-ends use services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
 - For full-stack apps consider Docker or platforms like Heroku, Render, Fly, or a cloud provider. Build production artifacts with `npm run build` (or your project's build command) and follow the provider's deployment guide.
